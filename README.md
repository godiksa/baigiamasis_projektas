Hello!
This is my final project for CodeAcademy course egzamination which is to create an app for adding, editting, removing users to an unnamed event list.

I used [React.js (TypeScript)](https://react.dev/) with backend server of [Node.js (TypeScript)](https://nodejs.org/en) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as database.
Other dependancies include: `express, mongoose, cors, dotenv, vite and etc.`

I adopted [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) component styles as well as colors and achieved it by creating them with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

# Setup

- First, download or clone the repository
- Second, create .env file with your MongoDB URI and place it at dir: `server/.env`

# Getting Started

- Open the terminal on the main folder and write command: `./start-dev.sh`
- Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit the page by modifying `client/src/App.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- If you want to activate frontend and backend seperately:
  -- At your terminal cd to either `client` or `server`
  -- Run `npm ci` to update files and then `npm run dev`
